# Lotide

A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.

## Usage

**Install it:**

`npm install @amyfranses/lotide`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@amyfranses/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`
